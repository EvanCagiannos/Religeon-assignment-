        <p><div>The HAjj is a religious journey preformed by members of the Islamic belief to the holy city of Mecca, located in Saudi Arabia. Translated to 
           English, the word Hajj means "pilgrimage to the Kaaba". The Kaaba, or "House of Allah" in English, is a stone temple located in the center of Islam's 
           most important, and holiest site, known as the Masjid al-Haram, located within Mecca.
       <br><div>Historically speaking, during theb medieval period, would be pilgrims would gather in cities such as Basra, Damascus, and Cairo to prepare for 
           journey ahead towards the city of Mecca.

 The importance of the city of Mecca is extreme to the Ismalic religion, as it is the place of the Kaaba.
